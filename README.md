# Maze-Runner
This is my favorite project to date. This beauty had a 2-month development cycle (the largest of any project I have) and I am proud of it for so many reasons. On the surface, this is not much. This is a simple 2D console game. However once you start to look at the depth you can see how and why it took so long to create. Basically, Maze Runner is a recreation of the first dungeon in The Legend of Zelda video game on the NES. A short run down of the features includes a system that installs the game files, a save data system, a player with health and weapons, several enemy types, a boss, and a sound system. The weapons for the player includes the boomerang, bow and the sword. All of these things were created using only the standard C++ libraries and the command prompt. I used this project to challenge myself to see what I could create with minimal knowledge of the C++ language and just the windows command prompt. The end result was Maze Runner and its source code was just under 10,000 lines long. I really had a lot of fun creating this.

The changelog for this project is located [here on my website](http://alexdgray.com/pages/projects/mazeRunnerDetails.php) That log includes a detailed list of all changes made to the program after v0.3. This also includes summaries of each version and screenshots from the development process!

In the end, this project was a true blast to develop. Taking up 2 months of my life and hundreds of hours of development. I learned a ton about programming from the project. It was truly a fun learning experience. I loved it so much that it lead me to build this website just so I could show it off and give a place for others to download it and check it out. While the source code is a convoluted mess and nothing to be proud of, the project itself is.
